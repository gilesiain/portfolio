                <h4>WHY?</h4>
                <P>Sinking my teeth into vue.js as a framework, this was the
                    first time using it, I simply wanted to learn this framework
                    as it seems so popular at the moment (not to mention its
                    fast) and I decided to do something a little nostalgic with
                    it, I mean whats more nostalgic than a magic eight ball, I
                    really liked learning and working with this framework,
                    simple enough to get up and running and although doing
                    things are a little different than standard JS it was easy
                    enough to wrap my head around.</P>
                <h4>HOW?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Eight ball image and a little triangle image with a
                        message on it, layered on top of each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the eight ball image has been clicked a function
                        triggers a randomly generated number from zero to how
                        many values there are with in an array (each value
                        representing the directory of an image of said triangle
                        with each having a different message on it).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the random number is generated its value is used to
                        pull a string from the array with that number as its
                        index.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The string is than passed into image.src.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Leaving you with a different image generated each time
                        the eight ball is clicked, resulting in an magic eight
                        ball like experience as each image has a different
                        message on it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The animations are all achieved with standard css, I
                        also added a simple nav bar and using VUE router, you
                        can skip between pages all while they generate their own
                        url.
                    </li>
                </ul>
