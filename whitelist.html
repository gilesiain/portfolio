                <h4>WHY?</h4>
                <P>I used to be part of a few ARMA(Pc game) communities, a lot
                    of
                    these communities ran their own game servers and most of
                    them
                    where white listed, meaning if you wanted on the server you
                    had
                    to read and understand the server rules, you would then have
                    some what of an interview with a server admin to verify you
                    where going to follow said rules and not be a complete
                    menace on
                    the server or to other players. These interviews consisted
                    of an
                    admin briefly asking a few questions about the server rules
                    and
                    if you answered correctly then you'd get whitelisted, so I
                    thought, why not automate this and free up admin time for
                    other
                    things like server maintenance etc. </P>
                <h4>HOW?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client enters steam username.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using javascript (ajax), username gets passed to php,
                        where
                        the data(steamid,name,profile image) is grabbed using
                        xml,
                        the steamid64 is encoded to battle-eye anti cheat guid
                        first
                        then all data is passed back as an array to javascript
                        via
                        json.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once a profile has been found/verified, the user is then
                        asked randomly generated questions (with time limit)
                        about
                        the server rules, meaning if they got the questions
                        wrong
                        and tried again it would be completely different
                        questions
                        each time(no cheating),(not randomly generated or time
                        based
                        in project example).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly if the test is passed, then the guid(anti cheat
                        user
                        id) retrieved earlier would then be passed from
                        javascript
                        variable to php(ajax), using php a .txt file is appended
                        with said guid, once it has been appended a copy of this
                        file is sent to the game server via ftp(ftp_put).
                    </li>
                </ul>
