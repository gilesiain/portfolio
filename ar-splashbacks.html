                <h4>WHY?</h4>
                <P>I worked for a splashback company at the time and they were
                    thinking about ways to grab more customers in the form of AR
                    as
                    Dulux (famous paint brand) had an AR app where you could use
                    your mobile camera, point it at a wall, choose a colour and
                    it
                    would make that wall look like it was painted in the colour
                    you
                    selected. Looking about I came across an extension for
                    Aframe
                    (3D Javascript library) called AR.js and I made a prototype
                    where the customer print out a marker (marker based AR),
                    stick
                    it to their wall (where they wanted their splashback), point
                    their phone at it and it would make it look like they had a
                    splashback installed via AR, the fact the customer had the
                    hassle of printing out a marker was the reason it never
                    became
                    more than a prototype(the limitations of web based AR at the
                    moment)</P>
                <h4>HOW?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Customer prints out provided AR marker.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customer attaches marker to position of where splashback
                        would go.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now they enter the splashback measurements
                        (height/width).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next AR.js fires up, customer is prompted to allow
                        access to
                        mobile camera, AR.js takes the passed measurement
                        variables
                        and applies height/width to the 3D representation of a
                        splashback (its just a square 3D plain).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AR.js detects the marker from camera stream and attaches
                        the
                        3D object to it in 3D space, giving the illusion of an
                        actual splashback on their wall (exactly what augmented
                        reality is).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To choose colour there is a scroll-able list of colours
                        at
                        the bottom that when clicked on, passes the div colour
                        to
                        AR.js object and applies that colour as a texture, so
                        the
                        customer can decide on a colour within an AR
                        representation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 3D plain (augmented splashback), also has a cube-map
                        reflection attached to it, giving the "splashback" a
                        glass
                        look to it and making it more immersive for the
                        customer.
                    </li>
                </ul>
